COVID-19 - DSP declarations management
======================================

[![Conventional Commits][conventional-commits-image]][conventional-commits-url]

This project is about developing a web interface for management of COVID-19 private declarations.

**Project stack**  
* PHP 7.2
* MySQL 5.7
* Laravel 7.3.0
* Composer

## Install and run on local machine

### Prerequisites
Before start install, user will need:
* One [Bionic Beaver][1], and a non-root user with `sudo` privileges.
* [Composer][2]
* [Docker][3]
* [Docker Compose][4]

### Install local
* Clone repository
```shell script
git clone git@github.com:citizennext/covid-19-entry-dsp.git covid-19-entry-dsp
```
* Move into the `covid-19-entry-dsp` directory
```shell script
cd ~/covid-19-entry-dsp
```
* Mount the directories that you will need for your Laravel project and avoid the overhead of installing Composer
 globally
 ```shell script
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer install
```
* Set permissions on the project directory so that it is owned by your non-root user
```shell script
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ~/covid-19-entry-dsp
```
* Make a copy of the `.env.example` file that Laravel includes by default and name the copy `.env`
```shell script
cp .env.example .env
```
* Open the file using nano or your text editor of choice
```shell script
nano .env
```
* Modify and add parameters to reflect the specifics of your setup
```shell script
APP_NAME="DSP Declaraţii Coronavirus COVID-19"
APP_LOCALE=ro

DB_HOST=covid19-dsp-db
DB_DATABASE=laravel
DB_USERNAME=laravel
DB_PASSWORD=laravel
DB_ROOT_PASSWORD=toor

MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=0.0.0.0
MAIL_PORT=1025
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="covid19_dsp@testmail.com"

COVID19_DSP_API="<url_provided_provided_by_api_maintainer>"
COVID19_DSP_API_KEY="<key_provided_by_api_maintainer>"
CACHE_DECLARATIONS_PERSISTENCE=5 # time in minutes for cache persistence
ADMIN_USER='admin_dsp'
```

### Run local
* Run the `sh` script which deploy Docker environment. Use option `-h` - help in order to check all parameters
```shell script
./run.sh -m -t
```
* Check if all Docker containers are running
```shell script
docker container ls
```

         +"batch": 1,
       },
     ],
   }
>>> 
```

### Reset admin user password
The admin user designated by the customer (DSP) has a `username` set in `.env` file - `ADMIN_USER='admin_dsp'` - and the `generic password` is provided. If for any reason this password is changed or forget, we implemented an Artisan command for resetting to the generic value.   

In production, an administrator with SSH access to the server will run a command in the root of the application. On local/development just run this command in the app container in the root of the application.  
 
```
docker container exec -it covid19-dsp-app php artisan dsp:reset_admin_pass
```

### Re-seed or reset users
If for any reason you need to re-seed or reset `Users` table there is implemented two commands. The full list with
 users and generic passwords are located on `\database\data\users_dsp.json`.   

In production, an administrator with SSH access to the server will run commands in the root of the application. On
 local/development just run this commands in the app container in the root of the application.  

Re-seed `Users` table, attention this command will truncate entire table.
```
docker container exec -it covid19-dsp-app php artisan dsp:users:seed
```
Reset `Users` table, attention this command will truncate entire table, only user `admin_dsp` will remain having
 generic password.
```
docker container exec -it covid19-dsp-app php artisan dsp:users:reset
```

* Enjoy!
